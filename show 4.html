    <p>The man who invented a solution to this problem was named 
        Frederic Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in
         the field of photography and held over 70 patents by the end of 
         his career. His story of creativity and innovation, which I will share now, 
         is a useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative process.
