    <p>For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to commission 
        an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were 
        used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. This process 
        of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.</p>
