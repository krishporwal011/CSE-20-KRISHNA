    <pre>“While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the 
        problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in a state 
        of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw before me,

        the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”</pre>
